title: 'Ode to a Mother’s Empty Hands'

<br>
Oh, giver of life, bearer of burdens,<br>
The one who held me when I was weightless,<br>
Who carved from her days a path for my feet— <br>
How is it now that I stand before you,<br>
Palms stretched, seeking, <br>
When it should be I who fills your hands?
<br>
Once, you conjured meals from bare cupboards, <br>
Sewed warmth into worn-out clothes, <br>
Turned scarcity into stories of hope, <br>
And I, unknowing, lived as if the world <br>
Would always be full because you willed it so.
<br><br>
Yet now, in this hour of reversal,<br>
When my hands should be the harbor of comfort, <br>
I find them trembling, empty still. <br>
To ask you—oh, to ask you— <br>
Feels like stealing from the moon her glow, <br>
Like reaching for the sky and pulling down the rain.
<br><br>
You smile, though I see the weight in your gaze,<br>
A softness laced with sorrow,<br>
A kindness that forgives before I even speak. <br>
How cruel, this world, <br>
That time should make me late in my giving, <br>
That love should stand in the shadow of need.
<br><br>
Oh, Mother, may my days be swift to change,<br>
May fortune soon fill these calloused hands,<br>
That never again shall you turn out your pockets <br>
Only to find echoes where gold should be.
<br><br>
And when that day comes, as surely it must,<br>
Let me lay in your palms what you once laid in mine— <br>
Not just coins, not just comfort,<br>
But the deep, unwavering rest <br>
That a mother deserves.
