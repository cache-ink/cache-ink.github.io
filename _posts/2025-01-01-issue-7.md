## On Starting a Blog

For years, I told myself the same story: “I’ll write when I’m ready.”

I wasn’t sure what "ready" meant, but I figured I’d know it when I saw it. Maybe it was when I felt wise enough. Or when I had something profound to say. Or maybe when I had the perfect writing voice something smooth, poetic, confident. Something that sounded like someone worth listening to.

So I waited.

And the weeks turned into months. The months into years. I consumed. I read other people’s essays, other people’s stories. I underlined clever turns of phrase and admired the effortless vulnerability of strangers. I told myself it wasn’t fear just patience. I was gathering my thoughts.

But the truth is, I was afraid.

Not of writing. But of being seen.

Because when you write honestly, you’re not just stringing words together. You’re making a map of your mind. You’re saying: this is how I see the world. And what if that map is naive? What if it’s embarrassing? What if people laugh at it or worse ignore it completely?

But here’s the thing I learned the hard way: no one starts wise. No one starts eloquent. No one starts at the finish line.

The only way to find your writing voice is to write before you’ve found it. You write through the noise. You write through the cringe. You write through the feeling that every sentence sounds like someone else said it better.

And eventually, one day, you write something that sounds like you.

Starting a blog isn’t about being an expert. It’s about being honest. It’s about noticing things, naming them, and sharing your lens on the world. That’s it.

The world doesn’t need more perfect voices. It needs more real ones.

So here I am, starting. Not because I’m ready. But because I’m tired of waiting to be.
