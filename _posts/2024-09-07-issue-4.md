<i>“Never be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity. The grave will supply plenty of time for silence.”</i> <br>—Christopher Hitchens<br>
Ever since the military regime, the Nigeria government’s response to protests has been draconian with the recent episode being its outplay in the protest against the rising cost of living in august 2024, where 29 children were charged with serious felonies and faced the possibility of the death penalty. These minors, barely out of childhood, were forced to confront a legal system that treats protest as treason, and dissent as a crime.
The death penalty for children—an absurdity under international human rights standards—is a brutal reminder of the extent to which the state will go to silence voices of resistance. Such measures are not only a violation of human rights but also a deep betrayal of the democratic promise. In a country where the voice of the people should be paramount, the government’s readiness to prosecute even the youngest among us sends a chilling message: dissent will not be tolerated, and silence is enforced through fear.
The words of Christopher Hitchens above remind us that silence is not an option. Every day, Nigerian citizens face the harsh reality of policies that starve, of security forces that brutally silence dissent, and of a system that privileges a few at the expense of the many. But in these challenges lies the possibility of transformation. The resilience of the Nigerian people, their courage in the face of oppression, and their unyielding demand for justice offer a beacon of hope for a brighter future.
I believe to confront these injustices, there must be a collective awakening—a recognition that injustice in any form is a threat to the dignity of all. Active engagement, from grassroots organizing to international advocacy, is essential. Nigerians must hold their leaders accountable, challenge corrupt practices, and build systems that prioritize human welfare over fiscal expediency. They must speak out not only in protest but in constructive action, proposing solutions that uplift the most vulnerable and ensure that justice is not merely an ideal, but a lived reality.
This is a call for all Nigerians to reclaim their agency and to transform their society from within. It is a call to replace despair with hope, resignation with resistance, and silence with a resounding chorus of voices demanding justice. In a nation where the grave may one day come for us all, it is imperative that we use every moment before then to challenge injustice, to demand accountability, and to build a future where every Nigerian can live with dignity, opportunity, and hope.
May this post serve as both a record of the many injustices that have scarred Nigeria and a clarion call for change. For in the struggle against injustice, every voice matters—and every act of courage brings us one step closer to a society where fairness and human dignity are not aspirations, but everyday realities.
