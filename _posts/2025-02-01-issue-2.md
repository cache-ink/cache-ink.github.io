I woke up this morning to a song from my music playlist by John which has left me reflecting and pondering on what is just and and the question of who truly deserves it. <br>The logic, as I see it, often doesn’t—and perhaps can’t really check out with my life. The best things in life have been given to me undeservedly so! I now understand from first hand experience why the song writer called such a love ‘reckless love’
<br>I am celebrating another year of life today and couldn't help but marvel at the journey and how I’ve conspicuously seen God at work—even in the shadows. So far,  Life has only grown deeper, richer, funnier, stranger, and better with every passing year...
<br>Here’s to another loop around the helix 🍻 🧬 <br>
and <br>
Cheers to the benevolence of the Master Grand Weaver!!!<br>
