### The People You’d Die For May Not Die for You
## and other things life didn’t warn me about
<br>

There are lessons no one teaches you, not because they’re secrets, but because they’re too uncomfortable to say out loud. You don’t learn them in classrooms. They arrive through scars, through awkward silences, through the slow drift of people you thought would never leave.

Some truths land gently. Others gut you in the middle of an ordinary Tuesday.

This is a short list of the things life taught me the hard way. I didn’t learn them gracefully. But they’re mine now and have been etched into the person I’ve become.

## 1. The people you’d die for may not die for you
This one hurt.

We grow up with the idea that love is symmetrical. That loyalty begets loyalty. That if I’d jump in front of a bullet for you, surely you’d do the same. But life doesn’t honor that math.

Sometimes you pour your soul into someone, thinking they’ll protect it like you would. And sometimes they walk away without even noticing what they’ve broken.

That doesn’t make your love a mistake. It makes it human.

The lesson isn’t to stop loving. It’s to stop expecting love to echo back in the same key you sang it.

## 2. Strangers can save you in ways friends won’t
We like to think the people closest to us will be the ones who show up when it counts. But sometimes it’s the person you barely know who offers the lifeline.

I’ve been helped most profoundly by people who had no obligation to care. A kind word from a stranger. An unexpected gesture. A DM from someone I never met telling me not to give up.

There’s something holy about that the grace of being seen when you feel invisible. It taught me not to underestimate the power of asking, even when your voice shakes.

And it taught me to pay it forward.

## 3. Loyalty is not love
I used to wear loyalty like armor. I thought sticking around meant I was noble. That endurance was virtue.

But staying in places where your dignity is shrinking isn't love. It's fear dressed up as devotion.

Love doesn’t keep you small. It doesn’t punish you for needing more. And sometimes the most loving thing you can do for them and for yourself is to walk away.

Loyalty matters. But it’s not a substitute for being valued.

## 4. Help doesn’t always come from who you expect
Sometimes the ones you thought would catch you… don’t. Not because they’re bad people. But because they’re fighting their own battles. Or they simply don’t know how.

Learning to let go of those expectations saved me from a lot of quiet bitterness. Help might not come from the direction you're looking. But that doesn’t mean you’re alone.

Look sideways. Sometimes grace arrives through the side door.

## 5. Healing isn’t a return to who you were
For a long time, I wanted to go back to the version of myself before the disappointment, before the grief, before the things I don’t talk about.

But healing isn’t about getting back. It’s about going forward with a limp. It’s about building something stronger from the ashes of what collapsed.

You don’t return to who you were. You become someone new not in spite of what happened, but because of it.

And if you're lucky, someone gentler.

There’s more, of course. Life has a whole curriculum, and I’m probably still failing half the classes. But if you’re somewhere in the middle of learning these same lessons wondering why the math isn’t adding up just know this:

You’re not crazy. You’re not broken. You’re just waking up.

And that, by itself, is a kind of miracle.
